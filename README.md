# 🏥 Unplanned Hospital Visits – Hospitals
# 📌 Overview
Unplanned hospital visits are a major challenge in healthcare, often signaling gaps in post-discharge care and leading to higher costs.
This project uses big data and predictive modeling to identify patients most at risk of returning to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, enabling proactive intervention and better patient outcomes.

# 🎯 Problem Statement
Goal: Predict patients likely to have an unplanned hospital visit within a month after discharge.

Why it matters:

Improves patient care with targeted follow-ups

Reduces avoidable readmissions and operational costs

Optimizes hospital resource allocation

# 📊 Dataset
Source: CMS Hospital Unplanned Visits Dataset
Size: 67,000+ patient records from multiple hospital grades and regions

Features include:

Facility details

Patient demographics

Admission & discharge data

Treatment outcomes

Readmission rates

The dataset’s multi-regional scope allows comparison of care practices across different areas.

# 🛠 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Normalize numerical data

2. Feature Engineering & Selection
Identify key predictors

Create new features for performance boost

3. Model Development
Start with baseline models

Progress to advanced algorithms (ensemble methods, deep learning)

4. Validation & Testing
Train/Validation/Test split

Evaluate for generalization and accuracy

# 📈 Expected Outcomes
Predictive model to flag high-risk patients

Early intervention strategies to improve care plans

Reduced unplanned visits and improved hospital efficiency

# ✅ Impact
Patients: Better recovery and reduced complications

Hospitals: Lower readmission rates, optimized resources

Healthcare Systems: Reduced costs, improved quality of care
